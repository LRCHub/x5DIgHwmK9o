[00:10.65] You want the girl with the small waist, and the perfect smile
[00:16.55] Someone who's out every weekday in her dad's new car
[00:22.60] You tell me I shouldn't stress out, say, "It's not that hard"
[00:28.96] But I just got a feeling, this'll leave an ugly scar
[00:54.96] 
[00:35.41] If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"
[00:41.09] Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
[01:09.59] 
[00:47.16] Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you could change this fast
[00:53.38] She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
[00:59.37] I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
[01:05.62] She's got everything that I don't have
[01:08.62] And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
[01:17.47] She's got everything that I don't have, mmm-mmm
[01:40.97] 
[01:22.86] You want someone you can show off whenever you go out
[01:28.54] She'll wear a tight-mini black dress with all her friends around
[01:34.66] And then you'll probably spend the night at her nice, big house
[01:41.01] And by then I'll just be someone you've forgotten about, oh
[02:10.51] 
[01:47.36] If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"
[01:52.98] Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
[02:21.48] 
[01:58.96] Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you could change this fast
[02:05.45] She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
[02:11.24] I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
[02:17.54] She's got everything that I don't have
[02:20.41] And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
[02:29.49] She's got everything that I don't have
[02:32.44] 'Cause she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be
[02:53.94] 
[02:40.39] She's all I wanna be so bad, oh-oh
[02:57.39] 
[02:47.03] Stupid boy making me so sad, didn't think you would hurt this bad
[02:53.58] She's got everything that I don't have, how could I ever compete with that?
[02:59.21] I know you'll go and change your mind, one day, wake up and be bored with mine
[03:05.36] She's got everything that I don't have
[03:08.65] And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, (all I wanna be) so bad
[03:17.46] (So bad) she's got everything that I don't have
[03:20.42] 'Cause she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad
